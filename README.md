### 🤔 Solutions provided in the project

I created this project on the basis of the guidance provided in the materials from the previously mentioned course. In addition, I was inspired by looking at the web sites. 


### 💭 Conclusions for future projects

I would like to improve my JavaScript coding skills. In theory, the option to change the background and hide the page seemed simple, but practically it took me time to achieve the desired effect and proved more difficult than I thought.

### This is the first issue:
```
kod tutaj
```

I had trouble understanding the syntax of the language and could not use the right phrases to make the function work properly.


### ✅ Project Status
Project is: complete

The project was completed because I completed all the tasks that were stipulated as part of the homework.
